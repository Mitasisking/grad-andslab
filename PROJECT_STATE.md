## Current Milestone

**Phase: grading-notification call sites.** ACE tier overhaul + Label Options + notification
system stage 1 (`4026e1d`), In-Person Event Drop-Off (`df13969`), and the booth-handover
contact-lookup bug fix found via this session's click-testing (`0de1894`) are all **committed
and pushed** to `main`, migrations 0059-0062 all live on production. Active work: wiring real
call sites for the notification system — `ORDER_CONFIRMED` now fires from the Payfast webhook
on successful grading payment (**uncommitted**, see below). Two older audit items remain open
product/schema decisions — see **Blocked / Needs a Decision** below.

## Active File Manifest

Grouped by subsystem. Paths are relative to repo root. This lists what exists and is wired
up today — not a to-do list.

### App routes — public
- `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/experience/page.tsx` (+ `components/experience/*`)
- `app/services/page.tsx`, `app/prepare/page.tsx`, `app/contact/page.tsx`, `app/vendor/page.tsx`
- `app/terms/page.tsx`, `app/privacy/page.tsx`, `app/refund-policy/page.tsx`, `app/shipping-policy/page.tsx` (+ `components/legal/legal-page.tsx`)
- `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/signup/page.tsx`, `app/my-account/page.tsx`, `app/my-account/reset-password/page.tsx`

### Submission flow (grading intake)
- `app/submit/page.tsx`, `app/submit/layout.tsx`, `app/submit/wizard.tsx`
- `components/submit/step-grader-tier.tsx` — tier selector, now renders `TierOption.group`
  subheadings ("Flagship levels" / "Premium levels") when a company's tiers set `group`;
  companies without groups (PCG, PSA) render as a flat list, unchanged. Also renders
  `TierOption.description` under the tier label.
- `step-addons.tsx`, `step-review-pay.tsx`
- `components/submit/card-shipment-row.tsx`, `sports-card-search.tsx`, `manifest-rail.tsx`, `packing-slip.tsx`, `add-address-form.tsx`
- `app/api/submissions/route.ts`, `app/api/submissions/checkout/route.ts`
- `lib/submission-types.ts` (shared contract, see below), `lib/addresses-client.ts`
- `supabase/migrations/0059_add_ace_flagship_premium_tiers.sql`, `0060_allow_ace_flagship_premium_tiers.sql`
  — add `ace_premier`/`ace_ultra`/`ace_luxury` to the `submission_tier` enum and widen
  `chk_submissions_tier_matches_company` for ACE. Applied to production, verified.
- `supabase/migrations/0061_add_ace_label_option.sql` — adds `submissions.ace_label_option`
  (nullable text + CHECK, not a new enum) for ACE's Standard/Colour Match/Ace Label choice.
  **Applied to production, independently re-verified** via `information_schema.columns` (column
  exists, `text`, nullable) and `pg_get_constraintdef` (constraint definition matches the
  migration exactly). A prior note in this file said this was still pending — that was stale;
  ground truth is now confirmed directly against the database, not inferred. The ordering risk
  this note used to warn about (submission inserts failing for every grading company if this
  code shipped before the column existed) is resolved now that the column is live.
- Label Options selector (`components/submit/step-grader-tier.tsx`, below Turnaround, ACE-only)
  feeding `step-review-pay.tsx`'s subtotal and `app/api/submissions/route.ts`'s insert — click-tested
  live in the running app: selector renders/toggles correctly, hidden entirely for PCG/PSA.
- **In-person event drop-off** (`app/submit/wizard.tsx` detects it via `?intake=in-person&event=slug`
  or the global `event_settings` toggle; `step-review-pay.tsx` replaces the Courier section with a
  fixed free "In-Person Drop-Off (Table Intake)" line when active). `supabase/migrations/0062_add_in_person_event_intake.sql`
  adds `submissions.intake_channel/event_slug/handover_pin/intake_verified_at` and the singleton
  `event_settings` table. Click-tested live through Step 3 — Inbound correctly shows R0,00 and the
  Pay button enables without a courier selection; checkout itself (the actual DB insert) was **not**
  exercised since migration 0062 isn't applied to production yet.

### Customer dashboard
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/dashboard/submissions/page.tsx`, `app/dashboard/submissions/[id]/page.tsx` + `submission-detail.tsx`
- `components/dashboard/cert-link.tsx`, `photo-modal.tsx`, `pipeline-progress.tsx`
- `lib/hooks/use-realtime-submission.ts`

### Admin — grading intake & pipeline
- `app/admin/intake/*` (`intake-portal.tsx` — now also has a "Booth handover" PIN input below the
  existing QR-scan/manual-token flow), `app/admin/grading/*` (`grading-portal.tsx`)
- `components/admin/intake-order-panel.tsx`, `grade-entry-panel.tsx`, `qr-scanner.tsx`
- `app/api/admin/intake/{lookup,photo,photo-confirm,status}/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin/intake/booth-handover/route.ts` — verifies a 4-digit PIN against submissions where
  `intake_channel = 'in_person_event' and intake_verified_at is null`, atomically sets
  `intake_verified_at`, best-effort sends `sendGradingUpdate('RECEIVED_HQ', ...)`, returns the
  submission's `qr_code_token` so `intake-portal.tsx` can reuse the existing lookup-by-token flow
  to display it.
- `app/api/admin/grading/{queue,save}/route.ts`
- `lib/admin/submission-status.ts`, `lib/admin/photo-upload-client.ts`

### Admin — events
- `app/admin/events/page.tsx` + `events-settings-panel.tsx` — single global toggle
  (`active_event_slug` + `is_live`) for defaulting every `/submit` visitor into in-person mode
  without a booth QR code. Same inline per-page auth pattern as `app/admin/pools/page.tsx`
  (no shared `layout.tsx`/`requireAdmin()` for pages — that's an API-route-only convention).
- `app/api/admin/events/route.ts` — admin-only POST to update the singleton row.
- `app/api/events/active/route.ts` — public GET, read by the `/submit` wizard.

### Admin — pools & logistics
- `app/admin/pools/page.tsx` + `pools-board.tsx`, `app/api/admin/pools/status/route.ts`, `lib/pools/active-pools.ts`
- `app/admin/logistics/page.tsx` + `return-splitter.tsx`, `app/api/admin/logistics/mark-packed/route.ts`, `lib/shipping.ts`

### Shop
- `app/shop/page.tsx`, `app/shop/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/shop/checkout/page.tsx`, `app/shop/layout.tsx`
- `components/shop/*` (browser, grid, filters, sports-card-filters, category-tabs, subcategory-pills, region-toggle, product-type-toggle, cart-button, add-to-cart-button)
- `lib/shop/{availability,featured-products,grader,product-type,shop-url}.ts`
- `lib/cart/cart-context.tsx`
- `app/api/shop/checkout/route.ts`, `app/api/shop/orders/route.ts`, `app/api/shop/orders/release-stale/route.ts`

### Admin — shop management
- `app/admin/shop/*` (`shop-admin-dashboard.tsx`, `product-form-modal.tsx`, `product-thumbnail.tsx`, `types.ts`)
- Bulk import per grader: `bulk-ace-import/`, `bulk-pcg-import/`, `bulk-psa-import/`
- `app/api/admin/products/*` (CRUD, `[id]/auction`, `[id]/vault-grail`, `batch`, `photo`)
- `app/api/admin/psa/verify-cert/route.ts`, `lib/psa/cert-verification.ts`, `lib/cert-validation.ts`
- `lib/admin/{product-input,product-image-upload}.ts`

### Auctions
- `app/auctions/page.tsx`, `app/auctions/[id]/*`, `app/auctions/new/*`
- `components/auctions/{auction-draft-form,bid-form,bid-history,countdown-timer}.tsx`
- `app/api/auctions/*` (list, `[id]/bid`, `[id]/pay`, `close`, `weekly-checkpoint`)
- `app/api/admin/auctions/schedule-weekly/route.ts`
- `lib/auction-types.ts`, `lib/hooks/use-realtime-auction.ts`

### Payments & money
- `app/api/webhooks/payfast/route.ts`, `lib/payments/payfast.ts`
- `app/api/pricing/route.ts`, `lib/pricing-client.ts`, `lib/pricing/exchange-rate.ts`, `app/api/cron/update-exchange-rate/route.ts`
- `lib/currency.ts`
- `app/admin/financials/*` (internal ZAR-primary/GBP-bracket dashboard)

### Market trends / lore
- `app/admin/trends/*`, `app/api/admin/trends/{sweep,watchlist}/route.ts`, `app/api/cron/market-trends/route.ts`
- `lib/market-trends/{agents,english-pricing,japanese-pricing,run-sweep,types}.ts`
- `app/api/admin/generate-lore/route.ts`

### Misc integrations
- `lib/tcgdex.ts`, `app/api/sports-cards/{brands,search}/route.ts` — sports-card catalog
- `lib/email/resend-client.ts`, `send-order-confirmation.ts`, `templates/order-confirmation.ts` —
  existing payment-receipt emails (unchanged)
- `types/notifications.ts` — `GradingEmailStage` (8-stage union) + per-stage payload interfaces
  (`OrderConfirmedPayload`, `CollectionBookedPayload`, `ReceivedHqPayload`,
  `DispatchedToGraderPayload`, `ReceivedByGraderPayload`, `DispatchedToSaPayload`,
  `LandedAtHqPayload`, `DispatchedToCustomerPayload`), discriminated union `GradingEmailPayload`
- `lib/email/send-grading-update.ts` — `sendGradingUpdate(payload)`, dispatches by `payload.stage`;
  only `ORDER_CONFIRMED` has a real renderer today, the other 7 throw a named "not implemented"
  error (no silent no-op). Best-effort contract like the existing `send-*` functions — does not
  catch its own errors, callers must wrap in try/catch.
- `lib/email/templates/order-confirmed.ts` — `renderOrderConfirmedEmail`, the `ORDER_CONFIRMED`
  template. Reuses `order-confirmation.ts`'s `COLORS`/`escapeHtml` (same dark/gold palette, same
  hand-rolled inline-styled HTML approach — see Shared Contracts below for why). No call site
  wires this to a real trigger yet — nothing currently invokes it for this stage.
- `lib/email/templates/received-hq.ts` — `renderReceivedHqEmail`, the `RECEIVED_HQ` template.
  Wired to a real trigger: `app/api/admin/intake/booth-handover/route.ts` calls it on every
  verified PIN. Renders gracefully with an empty `inspectionPhotos` (true at booth-handover time,
  since dual-surface photos come from a later, separate step) vs. a real photo grid when populated.
- `getContact` in `lib/email/send-order-confirmation.ts` is now exported (was module-private) so
  `booth-handover/route.ts` can reuse the same profile+auth-email lookup instead of duplicating it.
- `app/api/contact-inquiries/route.ts`, `app/api/vendor-inquiries/route.ts`, `app/api/notify/route.ts`, `app/api/webhooks/pool-milestone/route.ts`
- `components/auth/turnstile-widget.tsx` — bot protection

### Shared infra
- `lib/supabase.ts`, `supabase-server.ts`, `supabase-route-client.ts`, `lib/require-admin.ts`
- `components/ui/{button,checkbox,input,label}.tsx`, `lib/utils.ts`
- `components/{Navbar,Footer,FeaturedCarousel,LivePools,PoolTracker,SocialIcons,WhatnotBanner,PackagingGuidelines}.tsx`
- `supabase/migrations/0001…0058` (56 files) — full schema history, `supabase/apply-all.sql`

---

## Shared Contracts (frozen — do not casually change)

- **`GradingCompany`** = `'PCG' | 'PSA' | 'ACE'` — `lib/submission-types.ts`
- **`SubmissionTier`** — union of all three companies' tier slugs (PCG unprefixed, PSA/ACE prefixed) — `lib/submission-types.ts`. ACE's current purchasable tiers: `ace_basic`, `ace_standard`, `ace_premier`, `ace_ultra`, `ace_luxury`. `ace_value` stays in the union (and the DB enum/CHECK constraint) for historical-row typing only — it is retired from `TIER_OPTIONS_BY_COMPANY.ACE` and must never be re-added there.
- **`TierOption`** gained two optional fields this task: `description` (marketing blurb, rendered under the label) and `group` (subheading key for the tier selector, e.g. ACE's `'Flagship'`/`'Premium'`). Both are optional and additive — PCG/PSA entries omit them and render exactly as before.
- **`SubmissionStatus`** = `'received' | 'inspected' | 'shipped' | 'graded' | 'returned'` (5-stage pipeline, `STATUS_STAGES`) — `lib/submission-types.ts`
- **`PoolStatus`** = `'open' | 'closed' | 'shipped' | 'completed'` — `lib/submission-types.ts`, table `public.pools` (migration 0035)
- **`ProductRegion`** = `'usa' | 'uk' | 'sa'` — `lib/shop/product-type.ts` — drives `tierPriceForRegion`, `cleanAndPolishFeeForRegion`, `inspectionFeeForRegion`, and shop currency display. **Policy**: USD/GBP/ZAR are independently-priced per region, never converted from one another at checkout time.
- **Currency display policy**: admin Financials dashboard is ZAR-primary with GBP bracket, deliberately. Public/customer-facing surfaces price natively per region (see above). Do not force ZAR-primary onto customer-facing pages — flagged explicitly in `launch_readiness_report.md` as a deliberate distinction, not a bug.
- **DB row shapes**: `SubmissionRow`, `PoolRow`, `SubmissionItemRow`, `SubmissionStatusLogRow` (`lib/submission-types.ts`) mirror `supabase/migrations/0001_init_schema.sql`, `0004_status_history.sql`, `0035_submission_pools.sql` — no generated `database.types.ts` exists; these are hand-maintained and must be kept in sync with migrations manually.
- **Route conventions**: admin API routes under `app/api/admin/**` gate on `lib/require-admin.ts`; client-facing DB errors must be generic with raw errors logged server-side only (pattern established in `app/api/submissions/route.ts`, since applied to `app/api/admin/products/*`).
- **PayFast webhook idempotency**: every branch in `app/api/webhooks/payfast/route.ts` gates its DB update on `payment_status = 'pending'` via an atomic `UPDATE ... WHERE`, and only fires its side effect when a row actually changed. Do not reintroduce read-then-write here.
- **Email templating convention (decided explicitly, do not revisit without asking)**: all transactional emails are hand-rolled HTML strings with inline styles in `lib/email/templates/*.ts`, never JSX/React Email — most email clients (Outlook especially) ignore `<style>`/CSS-in-JS. Every interpolated user-entered value MUST go through `escapeHtml` (`lib/email/templates/order-confirmation.ts`) — a real stored-XSS was fixed here before. `@react-email/*` is deliberately not a dependency. Senders live in `lib/email/send-*.ts` (not `lib/mail/`), take a payload, call `getResendClient().emails.send()` directly, and do not catch their own errors — the caller wraps in try/catch and only logs, since a notification failure must never fail the pipeline event that triggered it.
- **`GradingEmailStage`** (`types/notifications.ts`) — an 8-stage notification-layer lifecycle, intentionally more granular than the DB's `SubmissionStatus` (5 stages) or `shipment_batch_status` (5 stages, migration 0052). Most stages beyond `ORDER_CONFIRMED` have no DB column or call site yet — adding a stage here is a type contract, not a promise it's wired up.
- **`AceLabelOption`** = `'standard' | 'colour_match' | 'ace_label'` — lives in `lib/submission-types.ts` (with `ACE_LABEL_OPTIONS`/`labelOptionFeeForRegion`), **not** a separate `types/grading.ts` — that path was requested but deliberately not created, to avoid a second, competing home for grading-domain types alongside the existing single source of truth. Same per-submission modeling as `needs_clean_and_polish`/`needs_semi_rigids` (one choice for the whole batch, not per-card) — only ever non-null when `grading_company = 'ACE'` (enforced by `chk_submissions_ace_label_option_valid`, migration 0061). ZAR fees (R25/R75) are ACE's own designated retail prices, not the usual ~18.5 USD/ZAR stand-in conversion; USD is still the derived stand-in.
- **`IntakeChannel`** = `'online_shipment' | 'in_person_event'` and **`EventSettingsRow`** — `lib/submission-types.ts` (again, not `types/grading.ts` — same reasoning as `AceLabelOption` above; every new domain type this session has gone into the existing file, not a parallel one). "Awaiting Booth Handover" / "Received & Logged" are **UI labels derived from `intake_channel` + `intake_verified_at`**, deliberately not new `SubmissionStatus` enum values — that enum is shared with the customer pipeline stepper (`STATUS_STAGES`/`PipelineProgress`) and `lib/admin/submission-status.ts`'s `changeSubmissionStatus`, which only accepts its fixed 5 values; extending it for a pre-`received` state would mean touching that shared stepper UI for a state most submissions never pass through. Every submission, in-person or not, still gets `status = 'received'` at creation, unchanged.
- **`event_settings`** is a Postgres singleton-row table (`id boolean primary key default true`, `check(id)`) — the same trick as any single-row settings table; there is deliberately no way to have zero or multiple rows.

## Uncommitted work in the tree right now

**Committed and pushed**: ACE tier overhaul + ACE Label Options + notification system stage 1
(`4026e1d`); In-Person Event Drop-Off (`df13969`); booth-handover contact-lookup bug fix
(`0de1894`), found via this session's click-testing of the admin events toggle and
booth-handover flow (both confirmed working live via real test submissions on production,
since cleaned up and independently re-verified — full detail is in that commit's history, not
repeated here). Migrations 0059-0062 all live on production.

**Uncommitted — `ORDER_CONFIRMED` call site wired**:
- `lib/email/send-grading-update.ts` — new `sendOrderConfirmedEmail(submissionId)`: fetches the
  submission + items + contact (via the now-exported `getContact`, using the service-role
  client — same lesson as the booth-handover fix, `getContact`'s `auth.admin.getUserById` needs
  it), builds the `OrderConfirmedPayload`, and calls `sendGradingUpdate`. Skips entirely for
  `intake_channel = 'in_person_event'` — that customer already has their PIN/QR on the dashboard
  and has nothing to ship, so a "here's your packing slip" email would be actively confusing.
  `packingSlipUrl` points at the existing `/dashboard/submissions/[id]` page, not a dedicated
  packing-slip route — `components/submit/packing-slip.tsx` is still unwired to any route (see
  its earlier note above); building that route is separate future work, not done here.
- `app/api/webhooks/payfast/route.ts` — calls `sendOrderConfirmedEmail(mPaymentId)` alongside
  the existing `sendSubmissionConfirmationEmail` call, both independently best-effort
  (`.catch()`-wrapped, matching the file's existing pattern exactly). **Note**: a customer now
  gets two emails on successful grading payment — the existing line-item receipt and this new
  pipeline-stage email. Whether to merge them is a product decision, not made here.
- `tsc`/`eslint`/`npm run build` all clean. **Not click-tested live** — doing so would require
  either faking a real signed Payfast ITN callback (its own `/validate` round-trip makes that
  hard to do authentically) or a full real sandbox payment; either way, actual email delivery is
  blocked regardless by the pre-existing Resend domain-verification issue noted below, so a live
  test wouldn't prove more than the code review + build already have. Verified by careful reading
  against the same patterns already live-tested in `RECEIVED_HQ`'s call site.
- **`RECEIVED_HQ` email delivery is still blocked** by an unrelated, pre-existing account issue:
  Resend rejects sends with "The cuppacards.com domain is not verified" (403). This affects every
  email this app sends, including this new `ORDER_CONFIRMED` call site — an account/DNS setup
  task, not something a code fix can resolve.
- **Not built, by design** (see Blocked / Needs a Decision below): a return-shipping selector
  ("Return Courier to Door" / "Vault / Marketplace Listing") — the original request said to
  "retain" this, but no such selector exists anywhere in the codebase to retain. Flagged and
  explicitly deferred rather than inventing new scope silently.
- Untracked, not yet triaged into the repo structure: `Stock photos/`, `TheCardApi.txt`,
  `claude context.txt`, `cuppa cards logo temp logo.jpeg`, `termsofservice.txt`, `zernio.txt`.

## Blocked / Needs a Decision

1. **Grader filter false-positive** (`components/shop/product-filters.tsx`'s `matchesGrader`) —
   bare title-substring match misclassifies a PCG card titled "ACE SPEC" as ACE-graded. Real
   fix is a `products.grading_company` column + migration, not a smarter regex.
2. **Currency-display policy scope** — ZAR-primary/GBP-bracket is confirmed correct for admin
   Financials. Open question: should that pattern extend anywhere in the public shop or
   customer emails, or stay admin-only?
3. **PayFast sandbox walkthrough** — IP allowlisting unimplemented; intermediate payment
   statuses (e.g. EFT) unconfirmed against PayFast's real sandbox. Needs someone with PayFast
   sandbox credentials, not another code pass.
4. **Return-shipping selector doesn't exist** — the in-person drop-off request assumed Step 3
   already had a "Return Courier to Door" / "Vault / Marketplace Listing" choice to retain.
   It doesn't. Deferred as its own future feature (new column + UI + order-summary wiring)
   rather than building it as an unplanned side effect of this task.

## Immediate Next Task

`ORDER_CONFIRMED` call site is wired and locally verified (`tsc`/`eslint`/build), waiting on your
go-ahead to commit. After that: fix the Resend domain-verification issue (account/DNS task, not
code) — nothing this app sends can actually deliver until that's resolved, which now includes
both `RECEIVED_HQ` and `ORDER_CONFIRMED`; the remaining 6 notification stages still have no call
site (`COLLECTION_BOOKED`, `DISPATCHED_TO_GRADER`, `RECEIVED_BY_GRADER`, `DISPATCHED_TO_SA`,
`LANDED_AT_HQ`, `DISPATCHED_TO_CUSTOMER` all still throw "not implemented" — none have a DB
trigger point yet, per `types/notifications.ts`'s header comment); the remaining older audit
items and the deferred return-shipping selector above.
